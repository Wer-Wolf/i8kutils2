i8kutils
========

Overview
========

i8kutils is a collection of utilities for controlling the fans on some Dell
laptops. The utilities are entirely built upon the `dell-smm-hwmon` kernel
module.

The i8kutils package includes the following utilities:

* i8kctl, a command-line utility for interfacing with the kernel module.
* i8kmon, a temperature monitor with fan control capability.

Since 2011 (kernel version 3.0), the kernel module exports temperature and
fan data over the standard linux hwmon interface. If you are running a recent
enough kernel, you might want to take a look at the [lm-sensors project](https://github.com/lm-sensors/lm-sensors).

Linux kernel module
===================

The full documentation of the `dell_smm_hwmon` kernel module can be found
[here](https://docs.kernel.org/hwmon/dell-smm-hwmon.html).

The following module parameters are worth mentioning:

* ignore_dmi=1
    * forces the driver to load on unknown hardware

* force=1
    * forces the driver to load on unsupported/buggy hardware
    * **might cause problems since it also disables all blacklists
      for buggy hardware, use only when `ignore_dmi=1` is not enough**

* fan_mult=<int>
    * overrides the fan speed multiplicator

* fan_max=<int>
    * overrides the maximum fan state

You can specify the module parameters when loading the module or as kernel
parameter when booting the kernel if the driver is builtin.

To have the module loaded automatically at boot you must manually add the
line "dell-smm-hwmon" into the file /etc/modules or use the modconf utility.
For example:

    $ cat /etc/modules
    # /etc/modules: kernel modules to load at boot time.
    #
    # This file contains the names of kernel modules that should be loaded
    # at boot time, one per line. Lines beginning with "#" are ignored.
    dell-smm-hwmon

Any module parameters must be specified in /etc/modprobe.d/dell-smm-hwmon.conf.
To force dell-smm-hwmon to load on unknown/unsupported hardware, it should contain
the following line:

    options dell-smm-hwmon force=1

i8kctl
======

The `i8kctl` utility provides a command-line interface to the `dell-smm-hwmon` kernel driver.
It only supports a subset of the available sensors, use the `sensors` program to retrieve
all sensor data.

In order to modify fan speeds, the utility requires root privileges.

i8kmon
======

The `i8mon` utility provides a daemon for fan control based on the current temperature.
It can be configured by editing `/etc/i8kmon.conf` and is targeted towards machines
which do not provide adequate BIOS fan control.

The daemon requires root privileges.

Requirements
============

Python >= 3.9 and the `dbus-next` package is required for the utilities to work.

Installation
============

```sh
python3 -m pip install i8kutils
```

the low level BIOS interface used by the kernel module.
